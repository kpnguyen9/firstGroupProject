# firstGroupProject

As the name of the repo implies, this was my first project in my bootcamp where we soley focused on front end development. I was able to get an understanding of the DOM and how to implement commands to create and listen to click events. This project was particularly fun because I was able to learn how to fetch data from API's, learn how to read API documentation, and get a better understanding of how to implement JS methods to dynamically display content on the screen. 

How to use all features of the app:
  - The user is able to type in any National Park name in the input box provided
  - Upon submission, the app will display all National Parks that are related to the search
  - The user is then able to select the National Park of their choice
  - The app will then render the current weather forecast of the selected park along with cards that include campgrounds, details, and links to make reservations.
